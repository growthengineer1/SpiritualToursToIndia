## Environment Variables

**Already configured in Cloudflare:**
- âœ… `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key (encrypted)

The Worker automatically accesses this via `env.SENDGRID_API_KEY`.

## Testing Your Worker

### 1. Test the Worker Directly

```bash
curl -X POST https://spiritualtourstoindiaemail.sabin.workers.dev \
  -d "name=Test User" \
  -d "email=test@example.com" \
  -d "message=This is a test message"
```

Expected response:
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Email sent successfully"}
```

### 2. Test from Your Website

1. Visit your website contact form
2. Fill in all required fields (name, email, message)
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see the success message
5. Check `hello@spiritualtourstoindia.com` for the email

## Troubleshooting

### Email not received?

1. **Check SendGrid Dashboard:**

   - Look for recent email activity
   - Check for bounce/block reasons

2. **Check Cloudflare Logs:**
   - Go to your Worker in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for errors during form submission

3. **Verify SendGrid API Key:**
   - Ensure it's not expired
   - Check it has "Mail Send" permissions

### Common Issues
