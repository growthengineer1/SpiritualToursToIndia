1. **What is the best time to visit India for a spiritual tour?**
   
   October to March (winter months) offer the most pleasant weather for exploring temples, ghats, and outdoor spiritual sites. Special festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Kumbh Mela provide unique spiritual experiences. Summer months (April-June) are ideal for Himalayan spiritual destinations like Rishikesh and Dharamshala.

2. **Do I need a visa to visit India?**
   
   Yes, most international travelers need a visa. The e-Visa is available for citizens of 150+ countries and can be applied online. Tourist e-Visas are typically valid for 30-90 days. For detailed guidance, check our [India Visa Guide] (link to visa blog).

3. **Is India safe for solo travelers and women?**
   
   India is generally safe for travelers who take standard precautions.
